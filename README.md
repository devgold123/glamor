# glamor

![build status](https://travis-ci.org/threepointone/glamor.svg)

css for component systems

`npm install glamor --save`

(or)

```html
<script src='https://unpkg.com/glamor/umd/index.min.js'></script>
```

usage 
```jsx
import { style, hover } from 'glamor'
// ...
<div 
  {...style({ color: 'red' })} 
  {...hover({ color: 'pink' })}>
  zomg
</div>
```

motivation
---

This expands on ideas from @vjeux's [2014 css-in-js talk](https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js).
We introduce an api to annotate arbitrary dom nodes with style definitions ("rules") for, um, the greater good.

features
---

- really small / fast / efficient, with a fluent api
- framework independent
- adds vendor prefixes / fallback values 
- supports all the pseudo :classes/::elements
- `@media` queries
- `@font-face` / `@keyframes`
- escape hatches for parent and child selectors 
- dev helper to simulate pseudo classes like `:hover`, etc
- server side / static rendering
- tests / coverage

(thanks to [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for providing the infrastructure that allows us to run our build in real browsers.)

characteristics
---

while glamor shares most common attributes of other inline style / css-in-js systems,
here are some key differences -

- it does **not** touch `class`/`style` attributes, neither does it **not** generate pretty classnames; instead we use `data-*` attributes and jsx attribute spread ([some implications](https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite/issues/25)). This lets you define styles 'inline', yet globally optimize as one unit.
- in dev mode, you can simulate pseudo classes on elements by using the `simulate()` helper (or adding a `[data-simulate-<pseudo>]` attribute manually). very useful, especially when combined when hot-loading and/or editing directly in your browser devtools.
- in production, we switch to a **much** faster method of appending styles to the document, able to add 10s of 1000s of rules in milliseconds. the caveat with this approach is that those styles will [not be editable in chrome/firefox devtools](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=387952) (which is fine, for prod?). advanced users may use `speedy(true/false)` to toggle this setting manually.
