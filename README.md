# threepointone/react-css

yet another attempt at css-in-js for react et al

`npm install @threepointone/react-css --save`

This one uses the [CSSStyleSheet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleSheet)
api to add/remove css rules from a stylesheet object, using a generated hash of the
style description to index itself. This gives us some flexibility in generating
and combining styles in a functional/react-y manner. Further, we internally use data-* attributes
to annotate dom elements, leaving style/className untouched by our lib.

```jsx

import { style, hover, focus, nthChild, media } from '@threepointone/react-css'

// ...

<div {...style({ backgroundColor: 'blue' })}>
  looks like inline css, but gets converted/cached as a css rule
  <ul>
    <li> one </li>
    <li {...nthChild(2, {outline: '1px solid black'})}>
      two - has outline!
    </li>
    <li> three </li>
  </ul>
  <a {...hover({ fontSize: 22 })} {...focus({ fontWeight: 'bold' })}>
    compose with a spread operator
  </a>
  <div {...media('(min-width: 500px) and (orientation: landscape)', hover({ color: 'red' }))}>
    media queries!
  </div>
</div>
```

features
---

- fairly small / efficient
- lovely api, imo :)
- reuses common declarations
- _doesn't_ use `style`/`className` props
- supports all the pseudo classes/elements
- and media queries
- simulate pseudo classes in development
- composes well
- tests / coverage
- server side rendering

cons
---

- no real-world usage/ adoption

server side rendering
---

this api is mostly copied from [aphrodite](https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite);
render your component inside of a callback, and react-css will gather all
the calls you used and return an object with html, css, and an object
to rehydrate the lib's cache

```jsx
// on the server
import { renderStatic } from '@threepointone/react-css'

let { html, css, cache } = renderStatic(() =>
  ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<App/>)) // or `renderToStaticMarkup`

// when rendering your html
`<html>
  <head>
    <style>${css}</style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id='root'>${html}</div>
    <script>window._cssCache = ${JSON.stringify(cache)}</script>
    <script src="bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>`

// when starting up your app

import { rehydrate } from '@threepointone/react-css'

rehydrate(window._cssCache)

ReactDOM.render(<App/>, document.getElementById('root'))

```

caveat: the above will include all the css that's been generated in the app's lifetime.
This should be fine in most cases. If you seem to be including too many unused styles,
use `renderStaticOptimized` instead of `renderStatic`. This will parse the generated
html and include only the relevant used css / cache.


todo
---

- font face detection / on-demand loading
- animation / keyframe generation
- error checking / typechecks (flow? runtime?)
- compile time optimizations / statically generate css files al√° jsxstyle
- other frameworks?
- theming et al


profit, profit

I get it
